<br>

* **Description**

    The System manages a delivery company which is based on 4 different modules : 
    - <span style="color:#db320c;">Transport</span>
    - HR
    - Branches
    - Supplier

    The <span style="color:#db320c;">Transport</span> module is responsible for :
    - Orders, deliveries and trucks data management
    - Scheduling new deliveries and handling overweight
    - Truck scheduling by demand
    - Providing informative presentation of stored data information and data manipulations

<br>

* **Diagrams** (docs)

    - activity diagram : send delivery (Transport module)
    - sequence diagram : send delivery (Transport module)
    - sequence diagram : schedule delivery (Transport module)
    - class diagram (HR & Transport module)
    - object diagram (HR & Transport module)

                - provide suitable truck by demand
                - provide information about existing trucks


        - Forms

            - Delivery form

            - Requested Order
            - Site
            - Truck

    <br>

    - Data Access Layer (generic implementation of DTO and DAO will be given by demand)

        - DAO : object per structure
        - DTO : object per structure

### <span style="color:#77b268;">Set Card Game :</span>

* **Code Structure**
    - java
    - Multi-Thread
    - GUI
    - Log
    - Maven

     <br>

* **Game Properties** 

    - Cards : 81 cards in deck (maximum) in total, 12 on table. Divided to:

        - 3 colors (red, green, purple)
        - 3 quantities (1, 2, 3)
        - 3 shapes (S, U, Diamond)
        - 3 fills (stripes, full, blank) 
        
    <br>


    - Players : between 1-4 players (computer/human)

        - Artificial : 10 different levels (implemented on AI_IsCheater,AI_Action)
        - Human : 12 keys on keyboard for each player (4 keys per row)

            |  player 1  |  player 2  |
            | :--------  | :--------  |
            |  q w e r   |  u i o p   |
            |   a s d f  |   j k l ;  |
            |    z x c v |    m , . / |

    <br>

    - Rules :

        - A player can choose only 3 cards (it is possible to un-choose)
        - valid trio is 3 cards that are different by color & quantity & shape & fill
        - player who chose valid trio will get a point
        - player who chose invalid trio will be freezed for 3 seconds (no ability to play)

    <br>

* **Game Flow**

    - Start :
        
        - deck starts with 81 shuffled cards
        - dealer put 12 cards on table


    - Reshuffle :

        - there is no legal trio on table
        - time countdown to 0

    - Timer :

        - countdown of each reshuffle set to 30 seconds
        - countdown of each reshuffle resets when a player win a point
        - freeze countdown set to 3 seconds

    - End :

        - X button was pressed
        - there is no legal trio on deck + table
        <span style="color:#a2c09a;">!!! Winner with the best score is announced !!!</span>

* **Algorithms** :

    - Sorts :

        - Sorter : recieves an array and sorts the array by every sort implementation in sort_impl (shows time complexity using tqdm)
        - sort_impl : different implementations of sorting in ascending order
        - intro sort
        - insertion sort
        - bubble sort
        - merge sort
        - heap sort
        - quick sort
        - bucket sort
        - counting sort (also by digit)
        - radix sort

* **Language Syntax** : important syntax that I have came across in the following languages:

    - python
    - c++
    - java

<br>

* **Reviews** : important syntax that I have came across in the following libraries:

    - pandas
    - numpy
    - sympy
    - tensorflow
    - pytorch
    - sklearn
    - mathplotlib
